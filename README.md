## Project Overview

The SycoFusion backend handles all the server-side logic for user authentication, post management, likes, comments, and image storage. It connects to a MongoDB database for data persistence and uses Firebase for storing user-uploaded images.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionalities.
- **Post Management:** CRUD operations for user posts.
- **Like and Comment:** API endpoints to like and comment on posts.
- **Image Storage:** Firebase Storage integration for handling image uploads.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, likes, and comments.
- **Firebase Storage:** For securely storing and retrieving images uploaded by users.
- **Mongoose:** ODM for MongoDB, providing a straightforward schema-based solution.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later) or Yarn
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance
- Firebase account with a configured storage bucket

```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment variables as follows:

```bash
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
PORT=your-locahost-port
